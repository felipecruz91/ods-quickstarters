# ODS Quickstarters - tests

All tests of quickstarters follow the same scheme:

1. a single test file, named `jenkinsfile_test.go`, inside a folder named exactly as the `quickstarter type` (e.g. be-golang-plain) - which provisions a quickstarter, and then runs the `jenkinsfile` of the newly created component to build and deploy it
1. a directory `golden` housing golden records for the jenkins stages of the two runs (provision and build), as well as from sonarqube to verify the actual responses against
1. a quickstarter test always provisions the component into an ODS created namespace called `unitt` - which is created by the tests in [ods-core](https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-core/tree/master/tests). So those tests must be run first, thru `make test` in `ods-core/tests`

**ATTENTION**: For the tests to work the `cd_user` configured in `ods-configuration/ods-core.env` **MUST** have rights to create and manage a bitbucket project

## Anatomy of a quickstarter test
Lets look at a single test in detail - in this case the one for [spring boot](be-java-springboot/jenkinsfile_test.go)

1. Create the bitbucket repository for the quickstarter (and bitbucket project if needed)
```
	// cleanup and create bb resources for this test
	utils.CleanupAndCreateBitbucketProjectAndRepo(
		quickstarterName, componentId)
```

2. Start the provisioning of a quickstarter thru the webhook proxy

```
	// run provision job for quickstarter in project's cd jenkins
	stages, err := utils.RunJenkinsFile(
		"ods-quickstarters", // the repository 
		values["ODS_BITBUCKET_PROJECT"], 
		values["ODS_GIT_REF"], // branch on ods-quickstarters
		coreUtils.PROJECT_NAME,
		fmt.Sprintf("%s/Jenkinsfile", quickstarterName),
		coreUtils.PROJECT_NAME_CD,
		coreUtils.EnvPair{
			Name:  "COMPONENT_ID",
			Value: componentId,
		},
		coreUtils.EnvPair{
			Name:  "GIT_URL_HTTP",
			Value: fmt.Sprintf("%s/%s/%s.git", values["REPO_BASE"], coreUtils.PROJECT_NAME, componentId),
		},
	)
```

3. Verify expected stages from the `golden` [provisioning record](be-java-springboot/golden/jenkins-provision-stages.json) against the jenkins created `stages`

4. Trigger a jenkins build run instance (for the provisioned component)

```
	// run master build of provisioned quickstarter in project's cd jenkins
	stages, err = utils.RunJenkinsFile(
		repoName,
		coreUtils.PROJECT_NAME,
		"master", // branch
		coreUtils.PROJECT_NAME,
		"Jenkinsfile",
		coreUtils.PROJECT_NAME_CD,
		coreUtils.EnvPair{
			Name:  "COMPONENT_ID",
			Value: componentId,
		},
	)
```

5. Verify expected stages from the `golden` [run / build record](be-java-springboot/golden/jenkins-build-stages.json) against the response `stages`

5. Verify the created OCP artifacts, and if pods / deployments are available - thru tailor diff

```
	resourcesInTest := coreUtils.Resources{
		Namespace:         coreUtils.PROJECT_NAME_DEV,
		ImageTags:         []coreUtils.ImageTag{{Name: componentId, Tag: "latest"}},
		BuildConfigs:      []string{componentId},
		DeploymentConfigs: []string{componentId},
		Services:          []string{componentId},
		ImageStreams:      []string{componentId},
	}
```

All necessary utils, except for [scripts](scripts) are housed in [ods-core/tests](https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-core/tree/master/tests/utils)

## Running the tests
To run the quickstarter tests, some prerequisites are required, e.g. go, oc, jq, etc. You could install them in your local machine and just run `make test` in [this](Makefile) directory.

On the other hand, you could use a Docker image that ships all those required dependencies. By running `make test-docker`, the image will be built and will run all the quickstarters tests, without having to install any dependencies in your local machine.

The assets to build the Docker image are in the [ods-quickstarters-tests-runner](ods-quickstarters-tests-runner) directory.

If you're running behind a corporate proxy, update **both** the [Dockerfile](ods-quickstarters-tests-runner/Dockerfile) and [entrypoint.sh](ods-quickstarters-tests-runner/entrypoint.sh) files to configure them properly by setting the `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, ... values accordingly.

When running the container, a bind mount will be used, where the directories under the umbrella directory on the host machine is mounted into the `/work` directory within the container.

```cli
make test-docker
```
